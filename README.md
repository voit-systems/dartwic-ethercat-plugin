# DARTWIC EtherCAT Plugin

High-speed cyclic EtherCAT I/O for DARTWIC 2.0. The plugin runs one synchronous, full-duplex process-data exchange per periodic task tick and is designed for a 1 ms (1 kHz) task period.

The repository is standalone and does not contain or require the private DARTWIC source tree. Versioned Engine and Interface SDK snapshots are bundled for plugin development.

## Architecture

The runtime is intentionally split at a C ABI boundary:

```text
DARTWIC periodic task (ClangCL / Clang)
  ├─ batch snapshot fixed command channels
  ├─ encode the complete output process image
  ├─ call one synchronous C bridge exchange
  ├─ decode the complete input process image
  └─ batch-stage fixed telemetry channels
                    │
                    ▼
dartwic_ethercat_bridge.dll / .so (GCC or MinGW GCC)
                    │
                    ▼
             KickCAT master + NIC
```

No C++ objects cross the compiler boundary. The public bridge interface is `engine/include/dartwic_ethercat_bridge.h`, and `DW_EC_BRIDGE_ABI_VERSION` protects against incompatible binaries.

One `ethercat.cycle` task exclusively owns one `ethercat.master` module while running. Reads and writes occur in the same EtherCAT frame cycle. There are no per-channel network operations, background command queues, or change-detection delays in the hot path.

## Configuration

1. Create an **EtherCAT Master** module.
2. Select the dedicated physical EtherCAT adapter from the dropdown.
3. Create an **EtherCAT Cyclic I/O** periodic task and set its period to `1 ms` for 1 kHz operation.
4. Select the master and click **Scan Bus**.
5. Add mappings using the discovered slave/PDO dropdown, then select the corresponding RAPID channel.

The first release uses the PDO layout already exposed by each slave. Dynamic PDO reassignment is deliberately out of scope. Stopping a task stops cyclic exchange; it does not overwrite the last process-output values with an assumed safe state.

## Build the DARTWIC plugin

Requirements: Node.js 20+, CMake 3.23+, a vcpkg checkout, and the same supported compiler used by DARTWIC (ClangCL on Windows or Clang on Linux).

```shell
npm ci
npm run build:interface
cmake --preset windows-clang-release
cmake --build --preset build-windows-clang-release --target copy_engine_plugin
```

Set `VCPKG_ROOT` before using the presets. On Linux, use `linux-clang-release` and `build-linux-clang-release`.

## Build the KickCAT C bridge

KickCAT is fetched from [`leducp/KickCAT`](https://github.com/leducp/KickCAT) and pinned to commit `f10386d54f734d388a405b4dae506801e35c238b` (`v2.6-rc3`). The normal package and deploy commands build the bridge automatically, so no bridge override path is required. To build only the bridge, run:

```shell
npm run build:bridge
```

The canonical output is `build/bridge-windows/dartwic_ethercat_bridge.dll` on Windows and `build/bridge/libdartwic_ethercat_bridge.so` on Linux.

Windows requires the MSYS2 UCRT64 GCC, CMake, Ninja, and Python packages. The script creates an isolated Conan environment and obtains the Npcap development SDK automatically. Set `MSYS2_ROOT` only when MSYS2 is installed somewhere other than `C:\msys64`. Linux uses the system CMake toolchain and honors `VCPKG_ROOT` when provided.

Npcap must be installed on a target Windows machine. The bridge loads Npcap at runtime so a missing installation produces a useful adapter error rather than preventing DARTWIC from loading the plugin. Npcap runtime binaries are not checked into this open-source repository because redistribution requires an [Npcap OEM license](https://nmap.org/npcap/oem/).

## TwinCAT EtherCAT simulation

Use an external SubDevice simulator when testing the complete NIC, packet-driver, and wire path. [Beckhoff TE1111 TwinCAT 3 EtherCAT Simulation](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/products/automation/twinsafe/twinsafe-software/te1111.html) is the recommended Windows option and is available in TwinCAT for demo testing.

Run TwinCAT simulation on a separate EtherCAT-facing adapter (or a second machine) connected to the adapter selected in DARTWIC. Install Npcap on the DARTWIC Windows host for that physical connection.

## Tests and 1 kHz rate check

The standard native test suite covers unaligned PDO encoding, signed/scaled values, dynamic C bridge loading, ABI validation, full-duplex exchange, and a 20,000-cycle bridge throughput test:

```shell
ctest --test-dir build/windows-clang-release -C Release --output-on-failure
```

`ethercat_rate_test` runs the same synchronous exchange interface used by the plugin and reports mean/p99 exchange time and 1 ms deadline misses:

```shell
ethercat_rate_test --bridge /path/to/dartwic_ethercat_bridge.dll --adapter ADAPTER_ID --cycles 10000 --period-us 1000
```

Run it against the intended NIC and TwinCAT or physical slave chain. This measures the same synchronous bridge exchange path used by the DARTWIC task and reports host-side cadence separately from on-wire exchange time.

The plugin publishes these fixed diagnostic channels per task:

- `<task>.ethercat.exchange_time_us`
- `<task>.ethercat.actual_wkc`
- `<task>.ethercat.expected_wkc`
- `<task>.ethercat.failure_count`

Three consecutive exchange failures stop the task. Automatic reconnect is intentionally deferred so a control system does not silently resume outputs after an ambiguous bus interruption.

## Repository layout

- `engine/`: DARTWIC module, cyclic task, batch channel path, PDO codec, and bridge loader.
- `bridge/`: KickCAT-backed C ABI shared library.
- `interface/`: dropdown-driven module and task editors.
- `tests/`: codec, ABI loader, fake bridge, and throughput tests.
- `tools/ethercat_rate_test.cpp`: physical-adapter rate and deadline test.

## Current scope

This is an initial implementation intended for TwinCAT validation and hardware bring-up. Before production control use, validate the exact slave chain on the target real-time configuration, define application-specific output safety behavior, and measure worst-case—not only average—cycle latency.
